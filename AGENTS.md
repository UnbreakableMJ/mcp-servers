# AGENTS.md

Project-specific invariants for agents working in this repository. This file does not
restate the Spacecraft Software CLI Standard or the Rust guidelines — load those skills
instead. What follows is only what is true *here*.

## What this repository is

MCP server configurations for 13 host applications. `mcp.toml` is the source of truth;
everything under a host directory is **generated**. `mcpctl/` is a Rust binary that
generates, checks, and deploys them.

## Invariants — breaking any of these is a bug

1. **Never edit a file under a host directory.** `Antigravity/`, `Codex/`, `Goose/`, and
   the ten others are generated. The next `mcpctl render` reverts your change and CI
   fails on the difference. Edit `mcp.toml`.
2. **Never put a real API key in a tracked file.** Templates carry placeholders
   (`YOUR_CONTEXT7_API_KEY` and friends). Real keys exist only in `$HOME`, written by
   `mcpctl fill-keys`.
3. **A change is not done until it is deployed.** Nothing reads the templates — no host
   loads a file from this repository. `render` updates the repo; `deploy` updates the
   machine. Stopping after `render` leaves every host on the old configuration with a
   clean `git status`. This has happened twice: commit `cc1fcfb` and the `perplexity`
   server, which sat in all 13 templates and 6 of 15 live configs.
4. **Live configs belong to their tools.** `deploy` replaces only the MCP block, keeps
   servers it does not manage byte-for-byte, re-parses before writing, and backs up
   first. Do not weaken any of those; see `CLAUDE.md` § Deploying safely for why each
   one exists.
5. **Emitters must write empty collections**, not skip them. `available_tools: []`
   belongs to goose, and dropping it is silent data loss in a file we do not own.
6. **`serde_json` and `toml` are built with `preserve_order`.** Without it, env blocks
   alphabetize themselves on every render. Use `shift_remove`, never `remove`, on these
   maps — `remove` is a swap-remove under `preserve_order` and shuffles the block.
7. **Commits are signed** (Standard §6.3) and pushed only to `Spacecraft-Software` or
   `UnbreakableMJ` (§6.4).

## Build, lint, test

The toolchain comes from `nix develop`. The `rustup` toolchains on this machine are
linked against `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` and cannot execute on NixOS — `cargo`
resolves on `PATH` and then fails with "cannot execute: required file not found".

```sh
nix develop
cargo fmt --manifest-path mcpctl/Cargo.toml --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path mcpctl/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path mcpctl/Cargo.toml
cargo build --release --manifest-path mcpctl/Cargo.toml

./mcpctl/target/release/mcpctl check          # hosts agree with each other
./mcpctl/target/release/mcpctl render --check  # templates agree with the manifest
reuse lint
```

Both `check` and `render --check` are CI gates. Clippy runs with the full pedantic and
restriction set at `-D warnings`.

## Test the risky paths by running them

`deploy` and `fill-keys` write to files the user and their tools own. Reading the diff
does not tell you whether they are correct. Exercise them against a copy of the real
configs:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/homesim
cp -r ~/.codex ~/.gemini ~/.config/goose /tmp/homesim/   # and the rest
HOME=/tmp/homesim ./mcpctl/target/release/mcpctl deploy --yes --force
```

Every serious bug in this tool was found this way and none was visible in the diff: 13
goose extensions silently losing `available_tools: []`, placeholders being written into
live configs as credentials, and `deploy` and `fill-keys` reordering each other's output
forever. All three exited 0.

## Agent-facing behavior

`mcpctl` detects agents by **presence**, not by `=1` — a live Claude Code session exports
`AI_AGENT=claude-code_2-1-220_agent`. `AI_AGENT`, `AGENT`, and a truthy `CI` switch the
profile to agent: JSON output, no color, non-interactive. `CLAUDECODE`, `CURSOR_AGENT`,
and `GEMINI_CLI` are **informational only** and appear in `metadata.invoking_agent`; they
must never become behavioral switches.

Useful entry points when you do not know the surface:

```sh
mcpctl describe --json     # how this invocation resolved
mcpctl schema --json       # every command as JSON Schema Draft 2020-12
```

Every error carries a runnable `hint`. If you hit one, run the hint rather than guessing
at flags.

## Adding a host

Two edits, and the split matters:

- `mcpctl/src/dialect.rs` — one row in `HOSTS`, the host's *mechanics*: which key holds a
  URL, whether env vars are `env`/`environment`/`envs`, split or joined command,
  indentation, `type` values, how "enabled" is spelled.
- `mcp.toml` — one `[[hosts]]` entry, the *content*: template path, live config paths,
  flags.

The manifest validates that both sides agree; a host in one and not the other is an
error, not a silent omission.

## When a host changes its schema

Hosts revise their config format, and the failure is total rather than partial: the
host rejects the whole file and starts with **no** servers. Copilot CLI 1.0.80 began
requiring the `mcpServers` wrapper it had previously done without, and every server
vanished behind one line — `Failed to read configuration ...: Error: mcpServers:
Required`.

Fixing the `HOSTS` row is only half of it. `render` updates the template, but the live
config is still in the old shape, and `deploy` refuses it — ``no `mcpServers` block`` —
because `splice` locates the block by the wrapper the dialect now declares. That is the
right behavior: a wrapper migration restructures the whole file, and `deploy` is only
ever allowed to replace the MCP block (invariant 4). So the live file takes a **one-time
manual migration**, and it is not `deploy`'s job:

```sh
cp -p ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json.bak   # 0600 must survive
# wrap the existing root object in the new key, preserving the servers verbatim
mcpctl deploy --host GitHubCopilotCLI --dry-run   # expect dirty:false — wrapper was all
```

Confirm with the host's own loader rather than by reading the JSON. Every host worth
deploying to can list what it parsed, and that is the only check that proves the file
is acceptable to it:

```sh
HOME=/tmp/homesim copilot mcp list   # names every server it actually loaded
```

## Adding a server

One edit for a server that needs no credential: a `[[servers]]` entry in `mcp.toml`. Its
position in the file is the order every host lists servers in, and `tests/render.rs`
derives its parity expectation from `resolve_for`, so no test changes.

A server that needs a credential takes **three** more edits, and the third is easy to miss:

- `[[secrets]]` in `mcp.toml` — the `placeholder` ↔ `env` pair `fill-keys` resolves.
- `[servers.overrides.VSCode]` — VS Code cannot hold a literal secret; it wants
  `${input:<ENV>}`. An override replaces `env`/`headers` **wholesale** rather than merging,
  so every other variable in the block has to be repeated or it silently disappears on that
  host alone.
- `ACCEPTED` in `mcpctl/src/check.rs` — that override is a per-host difference, and
  `mcpctl check` reports any undeclared difference as drift. Without a `Variation` row for
  the new `VSCode`/`<server>` pair, `check` fails, and it is a CI gate.

Then the usual: `mcpctl render`, the gates, `deploy`, `fill-keys` (invariant 3).

Two things worth measuring rather than assuming, both learned the hard way (see `crates`
and `fetch` in `mcp.toml`): whether the server writes its logs to **stdout**, which
poisons the JSON-RPC stream and hard-fails strict clients, and whether its dependencies
need pinning. Probe stdout before trusting it:

```sh
tail -f requests.jsonl | timeout 10 <server command> > out.txt 2> err.txt
head -c 2 out.txt    # must be `{"` — anything else means logs are on the wrong stream
```

## Omitting a server from one host

`omit = true` in `[servers.overrides.<Host>]` means that host does not carry the server
at all — no entry is emitted anywhere. Unlike the `VSCode` overrides above there is **no**
`check.rs` row to remember: `check` reads omissions straight from the manifest and reports
them under `omitted`, separately from the `missing` list that fails the gate.

`enabled = false` is a different mechanism and not a substitute. A disabled server is
still written into the host's config and merely switched off. `context7` and
`microsoft-learn` are omitted for Claude Code because it hides a claude.ai connector whose
URL a locally configured server already claims, and it is *presence* of the URL that does
the hiding.

Invariant 3 bites harder here. `render` drops the entry from the template, but `deploy`
then sees the live entry as a **stray** and preserves it byte-for-byte, and `--yes` forces
non-interactive mode so it never prunes. Finish the job with `mcpctl deploy --host <Host>`
from a real terminal — no `--yes`, host not running — and answer `y` to each removal.

`mcpctl` only ever touches the **top-level** `mcpServers` block of `~/.claude.json`.
Claude Code also stores per-project servers under `projects.<path>.mcpServers`; `splice`
never looks there, so those copies are invisible to `deploy` and need
`claude mcp remove -s local`.
